    Web-Server Access Token:
        description: "The web server authentication flow is used by apps that are\

            \ is that the server must be able to protect the consumer secret. You\
            \ can use code challenge and verifier values in the flow to prevent authorization\
            \ code interception. In this flow, the client application requests the\
            \ authorization server to redirect the user to another web server or resource\
            \ that authorizes the user and sends the application an authorization\
            \ code. The application uses the authorization code to request an access\

    User-Agent Access Token:
        description: |
            The user-agent authentication flow is used by client apps(consumers) that reside on the user's device or computer. It's also used by client apps running in a browser using a scripting language such as Javascript. These apps can protect per-user secrets. But, because the apps are widely distributed, the client secret can't be confidential. In this flow, the client application requests the authorization server to redirect the user to another Web server or resource which is capable of extracting the access token and passing it back to the application.

                description : "The unique name of the object in the API. This name can contain only underscores and alphanumeric characters, and must be unique in your org. It must begin with a letter, not include spaces, not end with an underscore, and not contain two consecutive underscores. When creating large sets of data, always specify a unique DeveloperName for each record. If no DeveloperName is specified, performance may slow while Salesforce generates one for each record."

However, if Salesforce encounters a UserProvAccountStaging object with a matching ExternalUserId but different LinkState and SalesforceUserId values during this process, Salesforce checks the UserProvAccount IsKnownLink value. If the IsKnownLinkvalue is true, Salesforce doesn’t copy the LinkState and SalesforceUserId values from the UserProvAccountStaging object to the UserProvAccount object (all other values are copied). The default is false, meaning Salesforce manages the account relationship."
