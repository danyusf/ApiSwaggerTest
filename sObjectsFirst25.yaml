    Web-Server Access Token:
        description: "The web server authentication flow is used by apps that are\

            \ is that the server must be able to protect the consumer secret. You\
            \ can use code challenge and verifier values in the flow to prevent authorization\
            \ code interception. In this flow, the client application requests the\
            \ authorization server to redirect the user to another web server or resource\
            \ that authorizes the user and sends the application an authorization\
            \ code. The application uses the authorization code to request an access\

    User-Agent Access Token:
        description: |
            The user-agent authentication flow is used by client apps(consumers) that reside on the user's device or computer. It's also used by client apps running in a browser using a scripting language such as Javascript. These apps can protect per-user secrets. But, because the apps are widely distributed, the client secret can't be confidential. In this flow, the client application requests the authorization server to redirect the user to another Web server or resource which is capable of extracting the access token and passing it back to the application.
